## Project Information
Project Idea: Zarr is a format for compressed N-Dimensional arrays and uses many compression algorithms to handle the data. Each of these compression algorithms is bound with an identifier to identify them, But we donâ€™t have any registry to help other languages identify them. To fill this gap we need a registry to be defined for these codecs which is human-readable as well as machine-readable.  

**Project length:** 175 hrs

# Project Weekly Updates:
Project Progress and Information: [Link](https://hackmd.io/@uTe8Vo8gSYeCbwHsQI2Z2Q/SypXtPRD9)

## Pre-GSoC Work
* Created a Research file. [Link](https://hackmd.io/bJ19oZGxS7-_4yuoNY4qXw)
* Documented several codecs into this format.
```
* Blosc
- A brief about how the compression technique works(2-3 lines)
- Where the codec is primarily used(webpages, PNGs, JPEGs, OS etc.)
- Comparing compression and decompression benchmarks/speeds
- Any other info you think is useful
- Important links for the codec(GitHub, Blog post, Implementations etc.)
```
* Created an initial version of Research file on Codecs.
* Created a Pull Request for [Pre-commit configuration](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1015)

## Week 1 & 2
* Added following new codecs.
```
PackBits
Pickle
Quantize
Shuffle
ZFPY
Astype
Bitround
JSON
```
* Documented Codec informations in Research file.
* Created a Pull Request [Link](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1016)
* Created this HackMD for community to track project progress. [link](https://hackmd.io/@uTe8Vo8gSYeCbwHsQI2Z2Q/SypXtPRD9)

## Week 3 & 4
* Created a Github Repo to keep registry files. [Link](https://github.com/Alt-Shivam/Codecs-Registry)
* Created a **csv** file for Registry. [Link](https://github.com/Alt-Shivam/Codecs-Registry/blob/main/Registry.csv)
* Added ImageCodecs.
```
AEC
APNG
AVIF
Brotli
Brunsli
```
and there documentation in research file.
* Created a Pull Request. [Link](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1047)

## Week 5 & 6
* Created a Github-Pages website to show Codec Registry. [Link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/)
* Shifted Codec research file from docs to .md.
* Created a saperate page to show the research file. [Link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/Research.html)
* Added Basic Information on CodecRegistry website.

# Mid-Term Evaluations. :tada:
**Montors Review:**

## Week 7 & 8
* Added codecIDs to the codecs as per [NumCodecs.](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/tree/main/numcodecs)
* Created a new page to show the procedure to create a request to add a new Codec. [link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/AddNewCodec.html)
* Removed other codecs from registry as suggested by mentors. 
* Created a new page to keep other codecs saperate. [Link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/OtherCodecs.html)
* Defined a CodecID Naming Convention for codecs without codecIDs. [Link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/CodecID_Naming_Convention.html)

## Week 9 & 10
* Created a python script `main.py` for registry to perform the following operations:
- Search a codec in remote registry.
- If codec is not present in remote registry, script will redirect the user to the [link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/AddNewCodec.html).
- If codec is present in remote registry, script will display inforamtion `CodecID`,`CodecDescription`,`LastUpdate`,`Type` and `CodecResearch` file [link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/Research.html).

## Week 11 & 12
* Created `Example.json` file to store the examples of codecs. [Link](https://github.com/Alt-Shivam/Codecs-Registry/blob/main/Examples.json)
* Added support of `Example.json` file to `main.py` python program to show the examples to users.
* Added a guide `How to run and use python script` on official website. [Link](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/Others/PythonParser.html)
* Migrated Registry repo to official [zarr-developers](https://github.com/zarr-developers/).
* Links and minor fixes.


# Final Evaluations. :tada:
